To run the tests, use the pytest command. It will find and run all the test functions youâ€™ve written.

$ pytest

```bash
pytest
```


If any tests fail, pytest will show the error that was raised. You can run pytest -v to get a list of each test function rather than dots.

To measure the code coverage of your tests, use the coverage command to run pytest instead of running it directly.


```bash
coverage run -m pytest
```

You can either view a simple coverage report in the terminal:

```bash
coverage report
```

An HTML report allows you to see which lines were covered in each file:

```bash
coverage html
```
This generates files in the htmlcov directory. Open htmlcov/index.html in your browser to see the report.
